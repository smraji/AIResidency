It can be asymptomatic or cause dysphagia and regurgitation. Diagnosis is made by\\nbarium swallow; surgical repair is rarely required.\\nThere are several types of esophageal diverticula, each of different origin.\\n• Zenker's (pharyngeal) diverticula are posterior outpouchings of mucosa and submucosa through the\\ncricopharyngeal muscle, probably resulting from an incoordination between pharyngeal propulsion and\\ncricopharyngeal relaxation.\\n• Midesophageal (traction) diverticula are caused by traction from mediastinal inflammatory lesions or,\\nsecondarily, by motility disorders.\\n• Epiphrenic diverticula occur just above the diaphragm and usually accompany a motility disorder\\n(achalasia, diffuse esophageal spasm).\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nA Zenker's diverticulum fills with food that might be regurgitated when the patient bends or lies down.\\nAspiration pneumonitis may result if regurgitation is nocturnal. Rarely, the pouch becomes large, causing\\ndysphagia and sometimes a palpable neck mass.\\nTraction and epiphrenic diverticula are rarely symptomatic, although their underlying cause may be.\\nDiagnosis\\nAll diverticula are diagnosed by videotaped barium swallow.\\nTreatment\\n• Usually none\\n• Sometimes surgical resection\\nSpecific treatment is usually not required, although resection is occasionally necessary for large or\\nsymptomatic diverticula. Diverticula associated with motility disorders require treatment of the primary\\ndisorder. For example, case reports suggest doing a cricopharyngeal myotomy when resecting a Zenker's\\ndiverticulum.\\nGastroesophageal Reflux Disease\\nIncompetence of the lower esophageal sphincter allows reflux of gastric contents into the\\nesophagus, causing burning pain. Prolonged reflux may lead to esophagitis, stricture, and rarely\\nmetaplasia or cancer. Diagnosis is clinical, sometimes with endoscopy, with or without acid\\ntesting. Treatment involves lifestyle modification, acid suppression using proton pump\\ninhibitors, and sometimes surgical repair.\\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is common, occurring in 30 to 40% of adults. It also occurs\\nfrequently in infants, typically beginning at birth.\\nEtiology\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 12.

            "Appendicitis is a condition characterized by obstruction of the appendiceal lumen, leading to distention, bacterial overgrowth, ischemia, and inflammation. The classic symptoms include epigastric or periumbilical pain followed by right lower quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and fever. However, these symptoms are not always present, making diagnosis challenging. Appendicitis cannot be cured via medicine alone; surgical removal of the appendix is the standard treatment.\n",

However, these symptoms may not always be present, especially in children and the elderly. Appendicitis cannot be cured via medicine alone; surgical removal of the appendix is required for treatment.\\n\\nKey Points:\\n- Appendicitis results from obstruction of the appendiceal lumen.\\n- Classic symptoms include epigastric or periumbilical pain, right lower quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and fever.\\n- Diagnosis is primarily clinical, but imaging studies may be necessary for atypical cases.\",\n          \"Summary:\\nThe management of sepsis in a critical care unit involves rapid empiric antibiotic therapy, supportive measures, and identification and treatment of the source of infection.\\n\\nKey Points:\\n- Empiric antibiotic therapy is initiated based on suspected organisms and local susceptibility patterns.\\n- Supportive measures include respiratory and hemodynamic management.\\n- The source of infection is identified and treated, such as removing infected catheters or draining abscesses.\\n- Normalization of blood glucose improves outcome.\\n- Corticosteroid therapy may be beneficial.\\n- Activated protein C (drotrecogin alfa) may be considered for severe sepsis and septic shock.\\n- Other emerging therapies include cooling for hyperthermia and early treatment of renal failure.\\n\\nSafety Note:\\nConsult qualified healthcare professionals for the diagnosis, treatment, and individualized management of sepsis or suspected infection.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Surgery may be necessary for patients with more severe injuries to monitor intracranial pressure, decompress the brain, or remove hematomas.

However, these symptoms may not always be present, especially in children and the elderly. Appendicitis cannot be cured via medicine alone; surgical removal of the appendix is required for treatment.\\n\\nKey Points:\\n- Appendicitis results from obstruction of the appendiceal lumen.\\n- Classic symptoms include epigastric or periumbilical pain, right lower quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and fever.\\n- Diagnosis is primarily clinical, but imaging studies may be necessary for atypical cases.\",\n          \"Summary:\\nThe management of sepsis in a critical care unit involves rapid empiric antibiotic therapy, supportive measures, and identification and treatment of the source of infection.\\n\\nKey Points:\\n- Empiric antibiotic therapy is initiated based on suspected organisms and local susceptibility patterns.\\n- Supportive measures include respiratory and hemodynamic management.\\n- The source of infection is identified and treated, such as removing infected catheters or draining abscesses.\\n- Normalization of blood glucose improves outcome.\\n- Corticosteroid therapy may be beneficial.\\n- Activated protein C (drotrecogin alfa) may be considered for severe sepsis and septic shock.\\n- Other emerging therapies include cooling for hyperthermia and early treatment of renal failure.\\n\\nSafety Note:\\nConsult qualified healthcare professionals for the diagnosis, treatment, and individualized management of sepsis or suspected infection.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
